\begin{DoxyPre}
StreamBufferHandle\_t xStreamBufferCreate( size\_t xBufferSizeBytes, size\_t xTriggerLevelBytes );
\end{DoxyPre}


Creates a new stream buffer using dynamically allocated memory. See x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create\+Static() for a version that uses statically allocated memory (memory that is allocated at compile time).

config\+SUPPORT\+\_\+\+DYNAMIC\+\_\+\+ALLOCATION must be set to 1 or left undefined in \doxyref{Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h}{p.}{_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h_source} for x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create() to be available.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Buffer\+Size\+Bytes} & The total number of bytes the stream buffer will be able to hold at any one time.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Trigger\+Level\+Bytes} & The number of bytes that must be in the stream buffer before a task that is blocked on the stream buffer to wait for data is moved out of the blocked state. For example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 1 then the task will be unblocked when a single byte is written to the buffer or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. As another example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 10 then the task will not be unblocked until the stream buffer contains at least 10 bytes or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. If a reading task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires before the trigger level is reached then the task will still receive however many bytes are actually available. Setting a trigger level of 0 will result in a trigger level of 1 being used. It is not valid to specify a trigger level that is greater than the buffer size.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If NULL is returned, then the stream buffer cannot be created because there is insufficient heap memory available for Free\+RTOS to allocate the stream buffer data structures and storage area. A non-\/\+NULL value being returned indicates that the stream buffer has been created successfully -\/ the returned value should be stored as the handle to the created stream buffer.

Example use\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}

void vAFunction( void )
\{
StreamBufferHandle\_t xStreamBuffer;
const size\_t xStreamBufferSizeBytes = 100, xTriggerLevel = 10;

    // Create a stream buffer that can hold 100 bytes.  The memory used to hold
    // both the stream buffer structure and the data in the stream buffer is
    // allocated dynamically.
    xStreamBuffer = xStreamBufferCreate( xStreamBufferSizeBytes, xTriggerLevel );

    if( xStreamBuffer == NULL )
    \{
        // There was not enough heap memory space available to create the
        // stream buffer.
    \}
    else
    \{
        // The stream buffer was created successfully and can now be used.
    \}
